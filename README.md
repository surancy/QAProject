## Question Answering System

CMU 15611 - Natural Language Processing. [course website](http://demo.clab.cs.cmu.edu/NLP/).

This is the IR-based QA System. Performs NLP Task of Information Retrieval from given Wiki articles. This program automatically generates questions from given articles, and answers question based on the query and the article. Built the full question generation and question answering pipeline from document parsing, passage retrieval to question generation and question answering. Parsed documents across various topics and was able to generate questions and answers that are fluent, reasonable, grammatical and idiomatic English based on the information in the document. Generated questions and answers by calculating document similarities from using word mover's distance. Performed syntax parsing, including parts-of-speech (POS) tagging and named entity recognition (NER) classification to extract meaningful keywords from documents. Constructed semantic analysis, including dependency parsing to reconstruct sentence grammar to make fluent and reasonable questions and answers.
