### Input: article, question (list)

### Passage retrieval:
1. find top N sentences with relavence score
2. select the one from 1 if has similar structure as Q
3. if in 2 more than one sentences, go for the one with higher similarity
4. if in 2 no similar structure found, go for the first sentence (the highest similarity score)

### Answer generation:

#### Question classification:
##### wh- Questions:

if Q starts with "who" or Q contains "whom" that is not followed by a comma: [PERSON]

if Q starts with "where": [LOC]

if Q starts with "when": [DATE]

if Q stars with "what": [WHAT]

##### binary Questions:

if Q starts with "is", "are", "was", "were", "does", "do", "did", "have", "has", "had", "will", "would", "could"

##### other questions:
if Q doesn't fall into any of above category (DESCRIPTION/REASON):


#### Answer types:
[WHAT]:
1. restructure the Q
2. split the text into ngram based on the restructured Q
3. restructure the text before Q's position in text
4. find the NER tag in 3
5. if in 4 no NER tag, restructure the text to find ans
6. if in 3 no similar pattern found, restructure the text to find ans

[PERSON]:
1. Look for phrases with the NER tags: [PERSON][ORG] in the text that contains answer.
2. Look for phrases where proper noun is the **subject** within sentence.
3. if 2 is not satisfied, look for NER tags with [PERSON][ORG]
4. if in 3 there are more than one phrase with the specified NER, apply **novelty rule**, ans = the one does not appear in Q
5. if in 4 all NER tags are novel, look for the one with the closest distance from the sentence ROOT
6. Process the Question to formalize the Answer.

[DATE]:
1. Look for phrases with the NER tags: [DATE][TIME][CARDINAL] from the text that contains answer.
2. Use dependency parsing to formalize the answer.

[LOC]:
1. Look for phrases with the NER tags: [GPE][LOC], in the text that contains answer.
2. if more than one correct NER in the candidate text:
  - text = "The Old Kingdom is perhaps best known for the large number of pyramids constructed at this time as burial places for Egypt's kings"
  - Q = "What is perhaps best known for the large number of pyramids constructed at this time as burial places for Egypt's kings?"
  {'Old Kingdom': 'GPE', 'Egypt': 'GPE'}
  **novelty rule**: ans should be the one that doesn't appear in the Q
  - ans = "Old Kingdom"

[BINARY]:
Do the sentiment analysis for the top n sentences of candidate answer

[DESCRIPTION][REASON]:
reconstruct the candidate answer text to make it grammarly correct
